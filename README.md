# ShortDistUI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.2.  
This is the user interface (UI) for the short distance Maven Spring boot project. 
The short distance calculates the shortest route from a source planet - Earth - 
to any destination planet.  
The short distance UI contains three tabs:  
'planets' - for listing, adding and removing planets,   
'routes' - for listing the available routes, for adding and deleting a route and  
'distance' - for calculating a shortest route to a given destination planet node.
